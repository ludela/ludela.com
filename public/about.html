                LuDela co-founder Jamie Bianchini was riding a tandem bicycle
                through the African continent as part of an 81-country global
                expedition for peace called Peace Pedalers. Jamie piloted the
                tandem bike’s front seat while leaving the rear seat open to
                invite total strangers to join the journey as “guest riders.”

                On May 12, 2007 a 17-year old Kenyan man named Joseph approached
                Jamie at his lunch stop outside of Njoro, Kenya. Joseph asked if
                he could accompany Jamie to his final destination of the day of
                Elburgon. While tackling the steep hills to Elburgon, Joseph
                shared a common story of many African youth—he was forced to
                drop out of high school to help support his family. He could not
                afford school fees. He had big dreams and ambitions, but no
                means to attain them without education.

                Later that day, Jamie and his mother Carol offered to sponsor

                was nearly in tears, shaking with joy as he shared the news
                with his family. It was that day that Jamie realized his
                calling: to help educate those who really wanted to learn,
                grow, and contribute in the world. He didn’t know exactly how
                he would realize it, but on May 12th, 2007 a seed was planted
                to do something great in education one day.

              <p>
                Later that year in September 2007 Jamie was riding in Western
                Africa in the country of Burkina Faso. At the end of a long day
                he checked into a rustic guesthouse that did not have electricity.
                The guesthouse owner gave Jamie a candle to light his room. In
                the middle of the night, Jamie woke up to find his room filled
                with smoke and a candle fire burning next to his bed. Thankfully,
                he was able to put the fire out with only minor damage to a
                table and some holes in his boxer shorts. But the frightening
                candle experience that night led to the invention of the LuDela
                smart candle design the next day while out pedaling through the
                African countryside. He didn’t know exactly how or when he would
                bring the innovation to the world, but a seed was planted to use
                the idea to one day change the world.

                Joseph becoming the first in his family of 11 to graduate high
                school. Carol and Jamie were invited to stay the night with
                Joseph and his family. In the evening, they burned a massive
                Kerosene light, filling the small house with toxic fumes. All
