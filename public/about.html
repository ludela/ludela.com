                We are equally committed to doing our part in helping families

                educational foundations. With our charity partner Books for Africa,
                LuDela delivers rechargeable solar lights and books to communities
                in need for every LuDela smart candle and refill candle package sold.

                Our NoKero solar lights are twice as bright as toxic kerosene lamps
                and stop the poverty cycle of buying expensive kerosene fuel. Books
                are the foundation of education in any community and a proven vehicle
                to inspire and educate future leaders to help bring communities out of
                extreme poverty.

                  On May 12, 2007 a 17-year old Kenyan man named Joseph approached
                  Jamie at his lunch stop outside of Njoro, Kenya. Joseph asked if
                  he could accompany Jamie to his final destination of the day of
                  Elburgon. While tackling the steep hills to Elburgon, Joseph
                  shared a common story of many African youth—he was forced to
                  drop out of high school to help support his family. He could not
                  afford school fees. He had big dreams and ambitions, but no
                  means to attain them without education.

                <p>
                  Later that day, Jamie and his mother Carol offered to sponsor
                  Joseph’s education to enable him to finish high school. Joseph
                  was nearly in tears, shaking with joy as he shared the news
                  with his family. It was that day that Jamie realized his
                  calling: to help educate those who really wanted to learn,
                  grow, and contribute in the world. He didn’t know exactly how
                  he would realize it, but on May 12th, 2007 a seed was planted
                  to do something great in education one day.

                <br/>

                </h2>
                <p>
                  Later that year in September 2007 Jamie was riding in Western
                  Africa in the country of Burkina Faso. At the end of a long day
                  he checked into a rustic guesthouse that did not have electricity.
                  The guesthouse owner gave Jamie a candle to light his room. In
                  the middle of the night, Jamie woke up to find his room filled
                  with smoke and a candle fire burning next to his bed. Thankfully,
                  he was able to put the fire out with only minor damage to a
                  table and some holes in his boxer shorts. But the frightening
                  candle experience that night led to the invention of the LuDela
                  smart candle design the next day while out pedaling through the
                  African countryside. He didn’t know exactly how or when he would
                  bring the innovation to the world, but a seed was planted to use
                  the idea to one day change the world.

                  Joseph becoming the first in his family of 11 to graduate high
                  school. Carol and Jamie were invited to stay the night with
                  Joseph and his family. In the evening, they burned a massive
                  Kerosene light, filling the small house with toxic fumes. All
                  evening long, kids and parents coughed through the night.

                  front door. The first-hand experience of the negative health and

                  Three years later, after getting married to a former Peace
                  Pedalers guest rider Cristina and having two beautiful children,
                  Luca and Candela, those seeds of inspiration from years prior
                  finally began to blossom. Jamie made his first prototype of the
                  LuDela smart candle design in spring of 2014 and began searching
                  for the ideal technical co-founder partner to bring LuDela to
                  the world.

                  This led him to Eric Bauswell, CEO of Surface Ink in San Jose,
                  California. Jamie shared his vision to use the smart candle
                  innovation, inspired in Africa, as a vehicle to illuminate
                  impoverished communities around the world. Eric fell in love
                  with both the product and the social vision immediately. They
                  began iterating prototypes with the Surface Ink team in 2015
                  and the rest is history.
