We use your personally identifiable information to contact you about your orders, process credit card / debit card transactions, and ship products to you. We may send you information about our products and services, and new offerings. We may provide information to third party service providers that help us process orders, and fulfill and deliver products and services that you purchase from us.
          We may use third parties to help host our Site, send out email updates about the Site, provide marketing and advertising services for us, remove repetitive information from our user lists, and process payments. These service providers will have access to your personally identifiable information in order to provide these services, but when this occurs we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to limit their use of that information to helping us provide the service.
          Advertising. We may use how you browse and shop in order to show you ads for Company or our advertising partners that are more relevant to your interests. We may use cookies and other information to provide relevant interest-based advertising to you.

These interest-based ads may be presented to you while you are browsing our site or third-party sites not owned by Company.

          Legal Proceedings. We will share personally identifiable information with third party companies, organizations or individuals outside of Company if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
          Meet any applicable law, regulation, subpoena, legal process or enforceable governmental request.

          TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        </h2>
        <span class='date'>Last Updated 9/12/2016</span>
        <p>

          Welcome to LuDela, Inc. (“LuDela”)’s website located at https://www.LuDela.com/ (the “Site”). Please read these Terms and Conditions (the “Terms”) carefully because they govern your use of our Site and our mobile application (the “App”), and the purchase and use of our products available on our Site or App (the “Products”). To make these Terms easier to read, the Site, the Products and the App are collectively called the “Services”. By using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by these Terms, do not use any of our Services.

          We may modify the Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we’ll let you know either by posting the modified Terms on the Site or through other communications. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we modify them because if you continue to use the Services or if you purchase our Products after we have posted modified Terms on the Site, you are indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you may not use the Services or purchase any Products anymore. Because our Products are still being developed and our Services are evolving over time, we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services (including our Products), at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.

        </p>
        <h2>
          ARBITRATION NOTICE: UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE YOU FIRST AGREE TO THESE TERMS BY FOLLOWING THE OPT-OUT PROCEDURE SPECIFIED IN THE “ARBITRATION” SECTION BELOW, AND EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES DESCRIBED IN THE “ARBITRATION “SECTION BELOW, YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND LuDela WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
        </h2>
        </br>
        <h2>
          Account Registration
        </h2>
        <p>
          You may order Products and use the Services only if you are 18 years or older and capable of forming a binding contract with LuDela and are not barred from using the Services under applicable law. If you want to purchase the Products and use certain features of the Services you’ll have to create an account (“Account”). You can do this via the Site, the App or through your account with certain third-party social networking services such as Facebook or Twitter (each, an “SNS Account”). If you choose the SNS Account option we’ll create your Account by extracting from your SNS Account certain personal information such as your name and email address and other personal information that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access. It’s important that you provide us with accurate, complete and up-to-date information for your Account and you are responsible for updating such information, as needed, to keep it accurate, complete and up-to-date. You’re responsible for all activities that occur under your Account, whether or not you know about them.

        </p>
        <h2>
          Online Orders
        </h2>
        <p>
          You can purchase our Products via our Site. We provide a link in the payment section of our Site (“Payment Page”). When you click “Pre-order now”, your payment information will be handled by an independent third party service provider, Stripe, which operates under separate Terms and Conditions with respect to your online payment transaction. You understand that the purchase is towards a pre-order and you are paying the entire purchase price towards the Product upfront, authorizing our payment processing partner to charge you for the full purchase price of the Product.

        </p>
        <h2>
          Order Acceptance
        </h2>
        <p>
          We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to refuse or cancel any order for any reason. You will be charged at the time you place your order, not when your order is shipped. Some situations that may result in your order being canceled include limitations on quantities available for purchase, inaccuracies or errors in our Products or pricing information, or problems identified by our credit and fraud avoidance department. We will contact you if all or any portion of your order is canceled. If your order is canceled after your credit card (or other payment account) has been charged, we will issue a credit to your credit card (or other applicable payment account) in the amount of the charge.

        </p>
        <h2>
          Delivery of Products
        </h2>
        <p>
          By placing a pre-order for our Products, you are acknowledging and agreeing to support a new product that hasn’t yet been fully developed. You understand that the Products are under development, and numerous technical, financial, and practical obstacles may interfere with their delivery to you. We will use reasonable commercial efforts to deliver the products within the timelines estimated in the Order form. You understand that all scheduled shipment dates and estimated shipment dates are estimates only. We’ll make reasonable efforts to meet the scheduled shipment dates, but in no event will we be liable for any loss, damage, or penalty resulting from any delay in shipment or delivery.

          In case of any unforeseen delay, LuDela will keep you updated and communicate progress using the email address associated with your Account. In the event of inconvenience due to any unforeseen delay in the timeline, please inform us at support@ludela.zendesk.com and we will make reasonable efforts to resolve your issue.

        </p>
        <h2>
          Refund & Cancellation Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          You have 60 days from placing your pre-order to request a refund. After that point, if you change your mind about your support for our Product, we may not provide you a refund; however, we will consider in good faith any special circumstances that may exist.

          Product Warranties
        </h2>
        <p>
          LuDela warrants that for a period of one year from shipment, the Product will be free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use in accordance with the documentation provided with the Product. In the event of a defect, contact LuDela at support@ludela.zendesk.com for return instructions. LuDela’s sole obligation under this warranty will be at its option to repair or replace the Product and the replaced product will have warranty for the remaining period of the original warranty. This warranty does not apply to Products damaged by misuse, accident, or normal wear and tear. The Product is not designed for or warranted against damage from use in areas subject to extreme temperature, excessive moisture, or other inherently hazardous environments. ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE LIMITED TO THE DURATION OF THIS WARRANTY. EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED EXPRESS WARRANTIES SET FORTH ABOVE, LUDELA DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts so the above limitations may not apply to you. This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary by jurisdiction.
        </p>
        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          NEITHER LUDELA NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SERVICES, PRODUCTS OR CONTENT WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, PRODUCTS OR CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT LUDELA HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

          In no event will LuDela’s total liability arising out of or in connection with THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE the Services or PRODUCTS EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID TO LUDELA FOR USE OF THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY.

          Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you.

        <h2>
          Dispute Resolution, Governing Law
        </h2>
        <p>
          These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of Nevada without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Agreement to Arbitrate
        </h2>
        <p>
          You and LuDela agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services or Content (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an “IP Protection Action”). Without limiting the preceding sentence, you will also have the right to litigate any other Dispute if you provide LuDela with written notice of your desire to do so by email or regular mail at 1681 Belarra Street, Minden, NV 89423 within thirty (30) days following the date you first agree to these Terms (such notice, an “Arbitration Opt-out Notice”). If you don’t provide LuDela with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action or, if you timely provide LuDela with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, will be the state and federal courts located in the Carson City, Nevada and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. Unless you timely provide LuDela with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, you acknowledge and agree that you and LuDela are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and LuDela otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Arbitration Rules
        </h2>
        <p>
          The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Arbitration Process
        </h2>
        <p>
          A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a general Demand for Arbitration.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Arbitration Location and Procedure
        </h2>
        <p>
          Unless you and LuDela otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and LuDela submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Arbitrator’s Decision
        </h2>
        <p>
          The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. LuDela will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Fees
        </h2>
        <p>
          Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, LuDela will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
        </p>
        <h2>
          Changes
        </h2>
        <p>
          Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Changes to Terms or Services” section above, if LuDela changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to www.LuDela.com) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of LuDela’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and LuDela in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).
        </p>
        <h2>
          General Terms
        </h2>
        <p>
          These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between LuDela and you regarding the Services (including Products and Deals) and Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between LuDela and you regarding the Services and Content. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable (either by an arbitrator appointed pursuant to the terms of the “Arbitration” section above or by court of competent jurisdiction, but only if you timely opt out of arbitration by sending us an Arbitration Opt-out Notice in accordance with the terms set forth above), that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without LuDela’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. LuDela may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.

          Any notices or other communications provided by LuDela under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.

          LuDela’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of LuDela. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.
